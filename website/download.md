# Download and install

[[toc]]

Scarb is a native command line application that is available for Linux, macOS and Windows on all common CPU
architectures.

Scarb follows a biweekly release schedule.
Each release may include new features, enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations and breaking changes.
For detailed information about each release, consult
the [release notes](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/releases).

If you are not sure if you have Scarb installed or not, you can run `scarb --version` in your terminal.

## Requirements

To download Git dependencies, Scarb requires a Git executable to be available in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Install via installation script

Download and install Scarb quickly.
Select the tab for your computer's operating system below, then follow its installation instructions.

### macOS and Linux

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.
This will install the latest **stable** release.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh
```

If you want to install a specific version of Scarb (such as a preview version), run the following with the desired
version number.

```shell-vue
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v {{ rel.sampleVersion }}
```

### Windows

As for now, Scarb on Windows needs manual installation, but necessary steps are kept to minimum:

1. [Download the release archive](/download) matching your CPU architecture.
2. Extract it to a location where you would like to have Scarb installed.
   A folder named `scarb` in
   your [`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/knownfolderid?redirectedfrom=MSDN#FOLDERID_UserProgramFiles)
   directory will suffice:
   ```batch
   %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\scarb
   ```
3. Add path to the `scarb\bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
4. Verify installation by running the following command in new terminal session, it should print Scarb and Cairo
   language versions:
   ```shell
   scarb --version
   ```

### Uninstall

#### macOS and Linux

The installation script does not have uninstalling logic built-in.
It tries to minimize changes performed to the system, though, to keep the number of manual steps to remove Scarb low.

1. Remove the `$XDG_DATA_HOME/scarb-install` directory, usually this is `~/.local/share/scarb-install`.
2. Remove `~/.local/bin/scarb` symbolic link.

The installation script might have added path to `~/.local/bin` to `$PATH`, by adding appropriate lines
to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or others, depending on the shell running in the system.
If you wish, you can remove these lines, but often this is not desirable.

#### Windows

Simply undo steps done to manually install Scarb:

1. Remove extracted archive files.
2. Remove the path to the `scarb\bin` directory from `PATH`.

---

On top of that, Scarb creates several files (like data files or caches) in standard system paths.
These have to be removed manually.
The list of all global paths written to by Scarb is listed in [here](./docs/reference/global-directories).

## Install via asdf

asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
Scarb team maintains an [official plugin](https://github.com/software-mansion/asdf-scarb) for asdf which manages
multiple Scarb installations.
This plugin needs `bash`, `curl`, `tar` and other generic POSIX utilities.
Everything should be included by default on your system.

When you have asdf already [installed](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html),
run the following command to add the `scarb` plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add scarb
```

Show all installable versions:

```shell
asdf list-all scarb
```

Install latest version:

```shell
asdf install scarb latest
```

Install specific version:

```shell-vue
asdf install scarb {{ rel.sampleVersion }}
```

Set a version globally (in your `~/.tool-versions` file):

```shell
asdf global scarb latest
```

Check [asdf guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for more instructions on how to install & manage
versions.

## By operating system
