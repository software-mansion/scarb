# Download and install

[[toc]]

Scarb is a native command line application that is available for Linux, macOS and Windows on all common CPU
architectures.

Scarb follows a biweekly release schedule.
Each release may include new features, enhancements, bug fixes, deprecations and breaking changes.
For detailed information about each release, consult
the [release notes](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/releases).

If you are not sure if you have Scarb installed or not, you can run `scarb --version` in your terminal.

## Requirements

To download Git dependencies, Scarb requires a Git executable to be available in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Install via starkup installation script

Starkup is a tool that helps you install all the essential tools for Cairo development, including Scarb.
This method only works on macOS and Linux.

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.dev | sh
```

Starkup uses asdf under the hood and will install it if not already present.
For more information on asdf, including how to manage and switch between different Scarb versions, see the [Install via asdf](#install-via-asdf) section below.
In addition to Scarb, Starkup also installs other useful tools, including [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/starknet-community-team/starknet-foundry), [Universal Sierra Compiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/universal-sierra-compiler), [Cairo Profiler](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-profiler), [Cairo Coverage](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairo-coverage), [CairoLS](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols) VSCode extension.

Check out the [Starkup repository on GitHub](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) for more information.

## Install via asdf

asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
Scarb team maintains an [official plugin](https://github.com/software-mansion/asdf-scarb) for asdf which manages
multiple Scarb installations.
Mind that asdf works on macOS and Linux only.
This plugin needs `bash`, `curl`, `tar` and other generic POSIX utilities.
Everything should be included by default on your system.

First [install asdf by following the official installation guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).
Make sure to complete all installation instructions from the guide,
in particular add asdf to your local shell's configuration.
Then run the following command to add the `scarb` plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add scarb
```

Show all installable versions:

```shell
asdf list all scarb
```

Install latest version:

```shell
asdf install scarb latest
```

Install specific version:

```shell-vue
asdf install scarb {{ rel.sampleVersion }}
```

Set a version globally (in your `~/.tool-versions` file):

```shell
asdf set -u scarb latest
```

Check [asdf guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for more instructions on how to install & manage
versions.

## Install via installation script

Installing via installation script is the fastest way to get Scarb up and running.
This method only works on macOS and Linux.

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.
This will install the latest **stable** release.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh
```

Run following command if you want to install the latest **nightly** release.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v nightly
```

If you want to install a specific version of Scarb (such as a preview or nightly version), run the following with the
desired
version number.

```shell-vue
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v {{ rel.sampleVersion }}
```

## Shell completions

Shell completions allow your terminal to suggest and automatically complete commands and options when you press `Tab`.

> [!WARNING]
> Most users **DO NOT** need to install shell completions manually.
> [Starkup](#install-via-starkup-installation-script) and [Scarb installation script](#install-via-installation-script) automatically set up shell completions for the supported shells.
> However, if these installation methods do not support the target shell (e.g. Windows installation), or for any reason fail to set up completions, you can follow the instructions below to set them up manually.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Bash</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` (macOS):

```bash
# BEGIN SCARB COMPLETIONS
_scarb() {
  if ! scarb completions bash >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  source <(scarb completions bash)
  _scarb "$@"
}
complete -o default -F _scarb scarb
# END SCARB COMPLETIONS
```

Run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`), or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>ZSH</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# BEGIN SCARB COMPLETIONS
_scarb() {
  if ! scarb completions zsh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    return 0
  fi
  eval "$(scarb completions zsh)"
  _scarb "$@"
}
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
compdef _scarb scarb
# END SCARB COMPLETIONS
```

Run `source ~/.zshrc`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Fish</strong></summary>

Add the following to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```sh
# BEGIN SCARB COMPLETIONS
function _scarb
  if not scarb completions fish >/dev/null 2>&1
    return 0
  end
  source (scarb completions fish | psub)
  complete -C (commandline -cp)
end
complete -c scarb -f -a '(_scarb)'
# END SCARB COMPLETIONS
```

Run `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Elvish</strong></summary>

Add the following to your `~/.config/elvish/rc.elv` file:

```sh
# BEGIN SCARB COMPLETIONS
try {
  eval (scarb completions elvish | slurp)
} catch { return }
# END SCARB COMPLETIONS
```

Run `eval (slurp <  ~/.config/elvish/rc.elv)`, or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>PowerShell</strong></summary>
Open your profile script with:

```bash
mkdir -Path (Split-Path -Parent $profile) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
notepad $profile
```

Add the following lines to the opened file:

# BEGIN SCARB COMPLETIONS
try {
    Invoke-Expression -Command $(scarb completions powershell | Out-String)
} catch {}
# END SCARB COMPLETIONS
```

Start a new PowerShell session to apply the changes.

> [!WARNING]
> At the start of the PowerShell session, you may encounter an error due to a restrictive `ExecutionPolicy`. You can resolve this issue by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> ```

</details>

## Uninstall

The installation script does not have uninstalling logic built-in.
It tries to minimize changes performed to the system, though, to keep the number of manual steps to remove Scarb low.

1. Remove the `$XDG_DATA_HOME/scarb-install` directory, usually this is `~/.local/share/scarb-install`.
2. Remove `~/.local/bin/scarb` symbolic link.

The installation script might have added path to `~/.local/bin` to `$PATH`, by adding appropriate lines
to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or others, depending on the shell running in the system.
If you wish, you can remove these lines, but often this is not desirable.

On top of that, Scarb creates several files (like data files or caches) in standard system paths.
These have to be removed manually.
The list of all global paths written to by Scarb is listed in [here](./docs/reference/global-directories).

## By operating system

Choose your operating system and tool.

### Windows

As for now, Scarb on Windows needs manual installation, but necessary steps are kept to minimum:

1. [Download the release archive](/download#precompiled-packages) matching your CPU architecture.
2. Extract it to a location where you would like to have Scarb installed.
   A folder named `scarb` in
   your [`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/knownfolderid?redirectedfrom=MSDN#FOLDERID_UserProgramFiles)
   directory will suffice:

   ```batch
   %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\scarb
   ```

3. Add path to the `scarb\bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
4. Verify installation by running the following command in new terminal session, it should print Scarb and Cairo
   language versions:

   ```shell
   scarb --version
   ```

#### Uninstall

Simply undo steps done to manually install Scarb:

1. Remove extracted archive files.
2. Remove the path to the `scarb\bin` directory from `PATH`.

On top of that, Scarb creates several files (like data files or caches) in standard system paths.
These have to be removed manually.
The list of all global paths written to by Scarb is listed in [here](./docs/reference/global-directories).

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Scarb can be used on Windows through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
To install Scarb in WSL, follow [the installation instructions](#install-via-starkup-installation-script) for Linux.
No additional steps should be required.

### NixOS

The community-maintained Cairo Nix overlay provides a ready-to-use Cairo development environment, which includes Scarb.

```shell
nix shell github:cairo-nix/cairo-nix
```
