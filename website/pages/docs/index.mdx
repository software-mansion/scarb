# Introduction

<Scarab />

Scarb is the [Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org) package manager.
Scarb downloads your Cairo package's dependencies, compiles your projects (either pure Cairo or StarkNet contracts),
and works as an entrypoint for other tooling to work with your code, such as [Protostar](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar) or IDEs.

Scarb is heavily inspired by [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
The goal is to make programmers used to writing Rust feel at home.
