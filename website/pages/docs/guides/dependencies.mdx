# Managing dependencies

Scarb manages dependencies by cloning packages from their Git repositories.
To add a dependency, simply declare it in your `Scarb.toml`.

<Callout type="info">
  Using Git submodules as a foundation for package management is not an ideal
  approach. Therefore, we plan to create a proper package registry in long term.
</Callout>

## Adding a dependency

If your `Scarb.toml` doesn't already have a `[dependencies]{:toml}` section, add it, then list the package name and the URL to its Git repository.
This example adds a dependency on the [`alexandria_math`](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria) package (note that Alexandria is a collection of multiple packages, and we will use math as an example in this guide):

```toml copy filename="Scarb.toml"
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git" }
```

In fact, it is always good to pin Git dependencies to concrete commits, otherwise Scarb would try to update this dependency each time it is executed.
You can achieve this using one of the following extra fields that you can pass along `git{:toml}`: `branch{:toml}`, `tag{:toml}` and `rev{:toml}`.
For example, in this guide we will pin to a concrete commit hash:

```toml copy filename="Scarb.toml"
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git", rev = "81bb93c" }
```

<Callout type="info">
  In the future this paragraph will be irrelevant, because Scarb will maintain a
  lockfile. We track this feature in this issue:
  [#126](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/issues/126).
</Callout>

Note, that if you want to add more dependencies, you do not have to add `[dependencies]{:toml}` for each package separately.

Now, run `scarb build{:shell}`, and Scarb will fetch new dependencies and all of their dependencies.
Then it will compile your package with all of these packages included:

```shell copy
scarb build
```

```text filename="Output"
    Updating git repository https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (/path/to/package/hello_world/Scarb.toml)
    Finished release target(s) in 4 seconds
```

You can now use the `alexandria_math` library in `lib.cairo`:

```cairo copy filename="src/lib.cairo"
use alexandria::math::fibonacci;
fn hello_world() -> felt252 {
    fibonacci::fib(0, 1, 10)
}
```

## Adding a dependency via `scarb add`

If you prefer, you can also ask Scarb to edit `Scarb.toml` to add a dependency automagically for you.
The `scarb add{:shell}` command accepts many parameters, matching all possibilities of expressing dependencies.
It can also automatically keep the list sorted, if it already is.
For example, the above example of dependency on `alexandria_math`, can be also added like this:

```shell copy
scarb add alexandria_math --git https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git --rev 81bb93c
```

## Removing a dependency

To remove a dependency, simply remove related lines from your `Scarb.toml`.

As a quick shortcut, the `scarb remove{:shell}` (also available in short `scarb rm{:shell}`) can clean the manifest automatically:

```shell copy
scarb rm alexandria_math
```
