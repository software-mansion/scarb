# Working on an Existing Scarb Package

If you download an existing package that uses Scarb, it's really easy to get going.

First, get the package from somewhere. For example, the [`quaireaux`](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/quaireaux) package is hosted on GitHub, and we 'll clone its repository using Git.

```shell copy
git clone https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/quaireaux
cd quaireaux
cat Scarb.toml
```

Then to build it, use `scarb build{:shell}`:

```shell copy
scarb build
```

```text filename="Output"
   Compiling quaireaux v0.1.0 (/path/to/package/quaireaux/Scarb.toml)
    Finished release target(s) in 4 seconds
```

This will fetch all of the dependencies and then build them, along with the package.
