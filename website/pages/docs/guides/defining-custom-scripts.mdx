# Defining custom scripts

`scarb run <script>` provides a cross platform way to define and execute custom commands specific to a codebase.

To get started, define your scripts in your codebase's `Scarb.toml` file under a "scripts" key.

For example:

```toml copy
[scripts]
foo = "echo 'Hello, world!'"
```

You can use `scarb run` without name argument to list all defined scripts.
For example:

```filename="scarb run"
Scripts available via `scarb run`:
foo                 : echo 'Hello, world!'
```

To pass additional arguments to the script, use `--` separator after the name.

For example:

```bash copy
scarb run foo -- hello world
```

Your scripts can use `scarb` as a command, which will reference the scarb binary used to execute the script,
regardless of your system configuration (namely, we will not search the `PATH` variable).
