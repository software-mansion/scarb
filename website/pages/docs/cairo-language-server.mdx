# Cairo Language Server

Scarb is distributed with the `scarb cairo-language-server` extension which is a compilation of the official
[Cairo 1.0 Language Server](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/main/crates/cairo-lang-language-server),
that is matching the version of Cairo compiler used in Scarb itself.
Scarb's version of the language server is just a launcher for the original code, unmodified.

## Visual Studio Code

The Cairo 1.0 Visual Studio Code extension will start language server from Scarb automatically.
You do not need to take any further steps.
Consult extension's [documentation](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/vscode-cairo/README.md)
for more detailed information.
