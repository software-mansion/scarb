# Starknet Contract Target

The `starknet-contract` target allows to build the package as a [Starknet Contract](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/getting_started/intro/).
It searches for all contract classes in the package, and builds a separate compiled JSON file each found class.
Generated file will be named with following pattern: `[package name]_[contract name].sierra.json`.

This target accepts several configuration arguments, beside ones [shared among all targets](../reference/targets#configuring-a-target), with default values for the default profile:

```toml
[[target.starknet-contract]]
# Enable Sierra codegen.
sierra = true

# Enable CASM codegen.
casm = false
# Emit Python-powered hints in order to run compiled CASM class with legacy Cairo VM.
casm-add-pythonic-hints = false

# Enable allowed libfuncs validation.
allowed-libfuncs = true
# Raise errors instead of warnings if disallowed libfuncs are found.
allowed-libfuncs-deny = false
# Reference to the libfuncs allowlist used for validation.
# - Use `allowed-libfuncs-list.name` to use built-in named allowlist.
# - Use `allowed-libfuncs-list.path` to read an allowlist from file.
allowed-libfuncs-list = {} # Cairo compiler defined
```

## Usage

To enable Starknet contract compilation for a package, write a following line in `Scarb.toml`:

```toml copy
[[target.starknet-contract]]
```

Then, declare a dependency on the [`starknet` package](/docs/starknet/starknet-package).
Its version is coupled to Cairo version included in Scarb.

```toml copy
[dependencies]
starknet = ">=1.0.0"
```

## Sierra contract class generation

The enabled by default property `sierra{:toml}` determines whether this target builds a Sierra
[Contract Class](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/contract-classes/) file.

## CASM contract class generation

Historically, contract classes have been defined in terms of Cairo assembly, or CASM for short (the class definition also included more information needed for execution, e.g., hint data).
The novelty of Cairo 1.0 is the introduction of Sierra, an intermediate layer between Cairo 1.0 and CASM.

When executing a contract on Starknet, the Sequencer downloads a [Contract Class] which contains Sierra bytecode.
It is a role of the Sequencer to compile it to CASM, which is a language that you can physically execute and generate proof of such execution.
If for any reason, there is a need to compile Sierra contract to CASM locally, Scarb can do that by turning the off by default property `casm{:toml}`.
If enabled, Scarb will emit the CASM Contract Class file in the target directory to a file named with following pattern: `[package name]_[contract name].casm.json`.

Historically, Cairo used to use Python as the language powering the [Hints](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/hints.html).
CASM contract classes can be still executed on the legacy Python-based Cairo VM, under condition that they include Python version of hints generated by Sierra, which now is an optional feature.
The off by default `casm-add-pythonic-hints{:toml}` property enables Scarb to add it to produced artifacts.

## Allowed libfuncs validation

Not all Sierra libfuncs emitted by the Cairo compiler can be deployed to Starknet, as some are not audited yet,
or others are meant for development use and would be unsafe when run in contracts context.
Therefore, the Starknet contract target runs a pass after compilation that checks if every emitted libfunc is present
in a provided _allowed libfuncs list_.
By default, this pass emits compilation warnings it spots unexpected libfuncs.

This validation pass can be disabled entirely by writing `allowed-libfuncs = false{:toml}` in target configuration.
On the other hand, its severity can be elevated to compilation errors, by writing `allowed-libfuncs-deny = true{:toml}`.

The default allowlist is compiler-provided and corresponds to list of all audited libfuncs allowed on Starknet.

### Built-in allowlists

The Starknet contract compiler contains several built-in allowed libfuncs lists, that can be identifier by name via
the `allowed-libfuncs-list.name{:toml}` property.
For example, to use the `experimental` allowlist, type the following:

```toml
[[target.starknet-contract]]
allowed-libfuncs-list.name = "experimental"
```

All built-in lists can be located in the [Cairo repository](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/main/crates/cairo-lang-starknet/src/allowed_libfuncs_lists).

### External allowlists

It is also possible to use a user-provided allowlist, via the `allowed-libfuncs-list.path{:toml}` property:

```toml
[[target.starknet-contract]]
allowed-libfuncs-list.path = "path/to/list.json"
```

User-provided lists should follow the same format as built-in ones.
