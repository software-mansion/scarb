# Starknet Contract Target

The `starknet-contract` target allows to build the package as a [Starknet Contract](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/getting_started/intro/).
It searches for all contract classes in the package, and builds a separate compiled JSON file each found class.
Generated file will be named with following pattern: `[package name]_[contract name].json`.

To enable it for a package, write a following line in `Scarb.toml`:

```toml
[[target.starknet-contract]]
```

This target does not accept any configuration arguments beside ones [shared among all targets](../reference/targets#configuring-a-target).
