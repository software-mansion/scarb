# Starknet Package

The `starknet` package provides APIs for writing Starknet contracts code.
This includes:

- A Cairo compiler plugin which expands contract-specific attributes (`#[starknet::contract]`).

The version of this package is coupled to Cairo version included in Scarb.

## Installation

This package is specially treated by Scarb.
To use it, simply declare a dependency on it in your package.
By using the `>=` operator, you will not have to manually update this value on each stable Cairo upgrade.

```toml copy
[dependencies]
starknet = ">=2.1.0"
```

## Future work

As for now, the `starknet` package's only purpose is to inform Scarb to enable the Starknet compiler plugin.
In the future it is planned to move the `starknet` module from `core` to this package.
