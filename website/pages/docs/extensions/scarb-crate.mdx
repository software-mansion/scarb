# Using Scarb as a library

Scarb is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) crate which can be used as a regular library in Rust applications.
We publish each release of Scarb to [crates.io](https://crates.io), the official package registry for Rust.

This crate serves as an API for writing custom extensions for Scarb.
It is not recommended to link to Scarb in regular unrelated applications, for this it is preferred to interact with Scarb binary.

<Callout type="info">
  The combination of calling scarb command with the `--json` flag, and the
  `scarb metadata` command should cover all use cases for communicating with
  Scarb from outside world.
