# The Manifest Format

The `Scarb.toml` file, present in each package, is called its _manifest_.
It is written in the [TOML](https://toml.io/) format.
It contains metadata that is needed to compile the package.
It has to be placed in the root of your project.
Use the `scarb manifest-path{:shell}` command to locate the manifest used in current directory.

Every manifest file consists of the following sections:

## `[package]`

The first section in a `Scarb.toml` is `[package]{:toml}`.

```toml copy filename="Scarb.toml"
[package]
name = "hello_world" # the name of the package
version = "0.1.0"    # the current version, obeying semver
authors = ["Alice <a@example.com>", "Bob <b@example.com>"]
```

The only required fields are [`name`](#name) and [`version`](#version).

### `name`

The package name is an identifier used to refer to the package.
It is used when listed as a dependency in another package, and as the default name of targets.

The name must use only ASCII alphanumeric characters or `_`, and cannot be empty.
It cannot also start with underscore.

In other words, it must match the following regular expression:

```
^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]+$
```

### `version`

Scarb bakes in the concept of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), so make sure you follow some basic rules:

1. Before you reach 1.0.0, anything goes, but if you make breaking changes, increment the minor version.
2. After 1.0.0, only make breaking changes when you increment the major version.
   Do not break the build.
3. After 1.0.0, don’t add any new public API in patch-level versions.
   Always increment the minor version if you add any new public structs, traits, fields, types, functions, methods, impls or anything else.
4. Use version numbers with three numeric parts such as 1.0.0 rather than 1.0.

### `authors`

This optional field lists the people or organizations that are considered the "authors" of the package.
The exact meaning is open to interpretation - it may list the original primary authors, current maintainers, or owners of the package.
An optional email address may be included within angled brackets at the end of each author entry.

```toml
[package]
authors = ["Software Mansion <contact@swmansion.com>", "Starkware"]
```

### `description`

The description is a short blurb about the package.
Package registries or indexers may display it with your package, some registries may even require it.
This should be plain text (not Markdown).

```toml
[package]
description = "A short description of my package."
```

### `documentation`

This field specifies a URL to a website hosting the crate's documentation.

```toml
[package]
documentation = "https://john.github.io/cairo-package"
```

### `readme`

This field should be the path to a file in the package root (relative to this `Scarb.toml`) that contains general information about the package.

```toml
[package]
readme = "README.md
```

### `homepage`

This field should be a URL to a site that is the home page for your package.

```toml
[package]
homepage = "https://example.com/"
```

### `repository`

This field should be a URL to the source repository for your package.

```toml
[package]
repository = "https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb"
```

### `license` and `license-file`

The `license` field contains the name of the software license that the package is released under.
The `license-file` field contains the path to a file containing the text of the license (relative to this `Scarb.toml`).

Package registries must interpret the `license` field as an [SPDX 2 license expression](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/).
The license name must be a known license from the [SPDX license list](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

SPDX license expressions support AND and OR operators to combine multiple licenses.

```toml
[package]
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"
```

Using `OR` indicates the user may choose either license.
Using `AND` indicates the user must comply with both licenses simultaneously.
The `WITH` operator indicates a license with a special exception.
Some examples:

- `MIT OR Apache-2.0`
- `LGPL-2.1-only AND MIT AND BSD-2-Clause`
- `GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Bison-exception-2.2`

If a package is using a nonstandard license, then the `license-file` field may be specified instead of the `license` field.

```toml
[package]
license-file = "LICENSE.txt"
```

### `keywords`

This field is an array of strings that describe your package.
This can help when searching for the package on a registry, and it is allowed to choose any words that would help someone find this package.

```toml
[package]
keywords = ["account", "wallet", "erc-20"]
```

It is recommended that keywords are ASCII text, starting with a letter and only containing letters, numbers and `-`.
Additionally, keywords should have at most 20 characters, and single package should not provide more than 5 keywords.

### `urls`

This field is a map of additional internet links related to this package.
Keys are human-readable link names, and values are URLs.

```toml
[package.urls]
"We can help you build your project" = "https://swmansion.com/services/"
"We're hiring" = "https://swmansion.com/careers/"
```

## `[dependencies]`

See [Specifying Dependencies](./specifying-dependencies) page.

## Target tables: `[lib]` and `[[target]]`

See [Targets](./targets) page.

## `[cairo]`

Adjust Cairo compiler configuration parameters when compiling this package.
These options are not taken into consideration when this package is used as a dependency for another package.

### `sierra-replace-ids`

Replace all names in generated Sierra code with dummy counterparts, representing the
expanded information about the named items.

For libfuncs and types that would be recursively opening their generic arguments.
For functions, that would be their original name in Cairo.
For example, while the Sierra name be `[6]`, with this flag turned on it might be:

- For libfuncs: `felt252_const<2>` or `unbox<Box<Box<felt252>>>`.
- For types: `felt252` or `Box<Box<felt252>>`.
- For user functions: `test::foo`.

```toml
[cairo]
sierra-replace-ids = true
```

## `[tool]`

This section can be used for tools which would like to store package configuration in Scarb.toml.
Scarb by default will warn about unused keys in Scarb.toml to assist in detecting typos and such.
The `[tool]{:toml}` table, however, is completely ignored by Scarb and will not be warned about.
For example:

```toml copy filename="Scarb.toml"
[tool.protostar.test]
report-slowest-tests = 5
```

No fields in this section are required or defined by Scarb.
Each field can accept any valid toml value including a table.
