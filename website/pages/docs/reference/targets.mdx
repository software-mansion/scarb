# Targets

Scarb packages consist of _targets_ which correspond to source files which can be compiled into a package, and the way how this package is compiled.
Packages can have a built-in library target, and/or more externally defined targets.
The list of targets can be configured in `Scarb.toml`.
By default, if the manifest does not list any targets, Scarb will assume the library target with its default parameters.

## Library

The library target defines a "library" that can be used by other packages.
In other words, if a package does not provide a library target, it cannot be used as a dependency.
If not specified, the name of the library defaults to the name of the package.
A package can have only one library target.

### Sierra and CASM code generation

The library target accepts following configuration parameters, with default values for the default _release_ profile:

```toml
[lib]
sierra = true  # Enable Sierra codegen.
casm = false   # Enable CASM codegen.
```

By default, the library target builds unprocessed Sierra code in textual form for the package.
When the `casm` option is enabled, Scarb can also automatically compile this Sierra code down to CASM.

## External targets

Scarb supports registering targets that are handled by Scarb extensions.
Such targets are called _external_ and are defined in a `[[target.*]]{:toml}` array of tables.

<Callout type="info">
  This is not fully implemented, and we track this work in [#111](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/issues/111).
  As for now, Scarb only supports internally hardcoded targets:

- [`starknet-contract`](../starknet/contract-target)

</Callout>

If multiple targets of the same kind are defined in the package, they all must specify unique [names](#name).

## Configuring a target

All of the `[lib]{:toml}` and `[[target.*]]{:toml}` sections in `Scarb.toml` support configuration options that are not target-specific and control how Scarb manages these targets.
The following is an overview of the TOML settings for each target, with each field described in detail below.

```toml
[lib]
name = "foo"  # The name of the target.
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Scarb reserves itself a right to introduce new global configuration fields in
  future versions. Potentially, new parameters may end up being conflicting with
  ones accepted by external targets. Introducing new parameters will always be
  done in major Scarb version bump, and will be loudly communicated earlier.
</Callout>

### `name`

The `name` field specifies the name of the target, which corresponds to the filename of the artifact that will be generated.
If missing, this defaults to the name of the package.
If multiple targets of the same kind are defined in the package, they all must specify unique names.
