  ## Community

Scarb is created by the same team at [Software Mansion] that is behind [Protostar], the Cairo and Starknet testing
framework.
We partnered with [Starkware], the creators of [Cairo] and [Starknet], while designing this tool.

Feel free to join [discussions on GitHub][gh-discussions] or chat with us on our channel on Starknet's [Discord]!
