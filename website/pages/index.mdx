  ## Community

Scarb is created by the same team at [Software Mansion] that is behind [Starknet Foundry], a toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts.
We partnered with [Starkware], the creators of [Cairo] and [Starknet], while designing this tool.

Feel free to join [discussions on GitHub][gh-discussions] or chat with us on our channel on Starknet's [Discord]!
