# Download Scarb

Scarb is a native command line application that is available for Linux, macOS and Windows on all common CPU architectures.

Currently, we publish release archives on our GitHub releases page, we recommend to download a suitable archive for the latest version and follow installation instructions.
In the future, we plan to provide a dedicated installer for all platforms.
We also include change logs for each release on this page.

## Requirements

To download Git dependencies, Scarb requires a Git executable to be available in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Installation

As for now, Scarb needs manual installation, but necessary steps are kept to minimum:

1. Download the release archive matching your operating system and CPU architecture.
2. Extract it to a location where you would like to have Scarb installed.
   A folder named `scarb` in your home directory (so: `~/scarb`) will suffice.
3. Add path to the `scarb/bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
4. Verify installation by running the following command in new terminal session, it should print Scarb and Cairo language versions:
   ```shell copy
   scarb --version
   ```

_Enjoy!_
