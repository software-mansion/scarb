# Generating documentation

`scarb doc` is a tool that generates documentation based on the code comments. Generation supports different output formats. The result is being placed inside the `/target/doc`.

## Supported output formats

- Markdown. Fully supported by [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). (Default)
- Custom JSON

## Available types of comments

As for now, we support those types of comments:

- `///` documentation for following item.
- `//!` documentation for enclosing item (also works with file modules).

the `///` and `//!` comment prefixes are supported.

## Item linkage

You can also link to another item's page by just referring the item within the documentation comment.
Currenctly we support only those types of links:

- `[ItemName]` and ``[`ItemName`]`` (where `ItemName` is a valid path to an item).

## mdBook

Generated markdown can be used to build a [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook) documentation.
You can do this directly from Scarb by running `scarb doc` with `--build` argument.

Alternatively, you can do this manually with the following steps:

- Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) by running `cargo install mdbook`.
- Run `scarb doc` inside the project root.
- Run `mdbook build` (or `mdbook serve`) inside the generated documentation target (`/target/doc/<PACKAGE-NAME>`).
  By default, mdBook generated documentation doesn't support Cairo code highlighting. To make it work, just replace the generated `book/highlight.js` with [this](https://github.com/software-mansion/scarb/tree/main/extensions/scarb-mdbook/theme) one.

## Examples

Let's take, for example, a simple Cairo project initialized using `scarb new`. Let's change the code inside `lib.cairo` to:

````cairo
//! This module is an example one.
//! It tries to show how documentation comments work.


/// Example Enum. It's really similar to [ExampleStruct]
enum ExampleEnum {
    /// First enum variant.
    VARIANT_A,
    /// Second enum variant.
    VARIANT_B
}

/// Example struct. Contains a public field and a private one.
struct ExampleStruct {
    /// Private field.
    field_a: felt252,
    /// Public field.
    pub field_b: felt252,
    /// [`ExampleEnum`] field
    field_c: ExampleEnum
}

/// Function that prints "test" to stdout with endline.
/// Can invoke it like that:
/// ```cairo
///     fn main() {
///         test();
///     }
/// ```
fn test() {
    println!("test");
}

/// Main function that Cairo runs as a binary entrypoint.
/// This function uses [test] function.
fn main() {
    //! This is an inner comment. It refers to it's parent which is the main function.
    println!("hello_world");
    test();
}
````

After running `scarb doc`, inside the target directory, you will see the generated documentation in `mdBook` format which consists of:

- The `src` directory, which contains the contents of your book in files with markdown format.
- The `book.toml` which contains contains settings for describing how to build your book.

Running `scarb doc --output-format json` will result in a single JSON file inside the target directory with collected documentation inside.
