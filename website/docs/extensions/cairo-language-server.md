# Cairo Language Server

Scarb is distributed with the `scarb cairo-language-server` extension which is a compilation of the official
[Cairo Language Server](https://github.com/software-mansion/cairols),
that is matching the version of Cairo compiler used in Scarb itself.
Scarb's version of the language server is just a launcher for the original code, unmodified.

## Visual Studio Code

The Cairo Visual Studio Code extension will start language server from Scarb automatically.
You do not need to take any further steps.
Consult extension's [documentation](https://github.com/software-mansion/vscode-cairo)
for more detailed information.
