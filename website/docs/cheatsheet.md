# Cheat sheet

Get started with Scarb by following a cheatsheet of the most important commands.

## Creating new project

```shell
scarb new project/directory
```

::: info
There is `scarb init` which runs in current directory instead of creating new one.
:::

## Compiling

```shell
scarb build
```

Built Sierra code of this package will be written to `target/dev` directory.

::: info
`scarb clean` cleans `target` directory.
:::

### Building CASM

Add following to `Scarb.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
casm = true
```

Adding following line to `[lib]` section will stop building Sierra code:

```toml
sierra = false
```

### Building StarkNet contracts

Add following to `Scarb.toml`:

```toml-vue
[dependencies]
starknet = "{{ rel.stable.starknetPackageVersionReq }}"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
```

## Adding dependencies

### In manifest

Add dependency hosted on a Git repository:

```toml
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git" }
```

Add dependency located in local path:

```toml
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { path = "../path-to-alexandria-checkout/alexandria" }
```
