# Package tarball

Package tarballs are distributable, compressed `.tar.zst` files with the source code of the package and additional
metadata for use by registries and other services.
Tarballs are regular [GNU tar archives](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>) compressed
with [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) algorithm.
The `scarb package` command can be used to create a package tarball from a package directory.

In general, a package tarball consists of the minimum amount of files copied from the package source directory,
along with several additional metadata files.
Scarb does not permit source files named like metadata files (case-insensitive) to be included in the tarball.

## Metadata

The package tarball contains the following metadata files:

### `VERSION`

The tarball version as a single ASCII integer.
The current tarball version is `1`.

### `Scarb.toml`

The package's `Scarb.toml` rewritten and normalized to contain only the most important information about a
package in order to be built, processed in version resolution algorithm and presented in the registry.

The normalization process consists of the following:

1. All workspace references are expanded.
2. All dependency specifications are stripped of non-registry source properties. For example:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   foobar = { version = "1.2.3", path = "../foobar" }
   ```

   is reduced to:

   ```toml
   [dependencies.foobar]
   version = "1.2.3"
   ```

3. All sections other than `[package]`, `[dependencies]` and `[tool]` are removed from the manifest.
4. All auto-detected properties, like `package.readme`, are explicitly stated.

### `Scarb.orig.toml`

The original `Scarb.toml` file from the package source directory, without any processing.

### `README` and `LICENSE`

If these files are present in the project root, or if paths to them are provided in the manifest, they are copied to the archive as `README.md` and `LICENSE` respectively.

### `VCS.json`

File containing info about the version control system used in your package.
Currently, only Git is supported.

```json
{
  "git": {
    "sha1": "a928d5ba03fc09d3316b39f04f30ee135df0c606"
  },
  "path_in_vcs": ""
}
```

It contains information about the hash of the commit that the package was created on, together with `path_in_vcs`, which describes the package's relative position to the Git working directory root.
It will be an empty string if it is the same as the package root.

## Package source

By default, only the `src` directory from package source is included in the tarball.
Additionally, the readme and license files may be included, if relevant fields are present in the source `Scarb.toml`
file (or if their values were auto-detected).
