# Managing dependencies

Scarb manages dependencies by cloning packages from their Git repositories.
To add a dependency, simply declare it in your `Scarb.toml`.

::: info
Using Git repositories as a foundation for package management is not an ideal
approach. Therefore, we plan to create a proper package registry in long term.
:::

## Adding a dependency

If your `Scarb.toml` doesn't already have a `[dependencies]` section, add it, then list the package name and the URL to
its Git repository.
This example adds a dependency on the [`alexandria`](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria) package (note
that Alexandria is a collection of multiple packages, and we will use `alexandria_math` as an example in this guide):

```toml
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git" }
```

You can pin a Git dependency to concrete commit, branch or a tag using one of the following extra fields that can be
passed along `git`: `branch`, `tag` and `rev`.

Actually this is how the OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo library is released, since the `main` branch is not stable.

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git", tag = "v0.7.0-rc.0" }
```

Note, that if you want to add more dependencies, you do not have to add `[dependencies]` for each package separately. For example:

```toml
[dependencies]
alexandria_math = { git = "https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git" }
openzeppelin = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts.git", tag = "v0.7.0-rc.0" }
```

Now, run `scarb build`, and Scarb will fetch new dependencies and all of their dependencies.
Then it will compile your package with all of these packages included:

```shell
$ scarb build
    Updating git repository https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria
    Updating git repository https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts
   Compiling hello_world v0.1.0 (/path/to/package/hello_world/Scarb.toml)
    Finished release target(s) in 4 seconds
```

You can now use the `alexandria_math` package in `src/lib.cairo`:

```cairo
use alexandria_math::fibonacci;
fn main() -> felt252 {
    fibonacci::fib(0, 1, 10)
}
```

## Adding a dependency via `scarb add`

If you prefer, you can also ask Scarb to edit `Scarb.toml` to add a dependency automagically for you.
The `scarb add` command accepts many parameters, matching all possibilities of expressing dependencies.
It can also automatically keep the list sorted, if it already is.
For example, the above example of dependency on `alexandria_math`, can be also added like this:

```shell
scarb add alexandria_math --git https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria.git --rev 27fbf5b
```

## Removing a dependency

To remove a dependency, simply remove related lines from your `Scarb.toml`.

As a quick shortcut, the `scarb remove` (also available in short `scarb rm`) can clean the manifest automatically:

```shell
scarb rm alexandria_math
```
