## Environment setup

Latest stable Rust is the only thing you really need.
It is recommended to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for getting it.

If you wish to work on Scarb's website, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
We recommend to install it using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) (via [nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) plugin).

## Contributing

Before you open a pull request, it is always a good idea to search the issues and verify if the feature you would like
to add hasn't been already discussed.
We also appreciate creating a feature request before making a contribution, so it can be discussed before you get to
work.

### Writing Tests

Please make sure the feature you are implementing is thoroughly tested with automatic tests.
You can check test already in the repository, to see how to approach that.

### Breaking Changes

If the change you are introducing is changing or breaking the behavior of any already existing features, make sure to
include that information in the pull request description.

### Running Tests and Checks

Before creating a contribution, make sure your code passes the following checks:

```shell
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
cargo test
```

Otherwise, it won't be possible to merge your contribution.

### Git

Try to make small PRs, that could be squashed into a single commit.
For larger work, try to make your commits small, self-contained and well described.
Each commit should pass lints and tests.
Then, set up a stack of pull requests, separate PR for each commit, and pointing to the previous one.

While your PR is being reviewed on, you can push merge commits and
use [`git commit --fixup`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit/2.32.0#Documentation/git-commit.txt---fixupamendrewordltcommitgt)
to push further changes to your commits.
