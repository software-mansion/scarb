        Thanks for filing a ðŸ™‹ feature request ðŸ˜„!

        If the feature request is relatively small and already with a possible solution, this might be the place for you.

        If you are brewing a big feature that needs feedback from the community, [the Scarb Telegram channel][tg] is the best fit.
        You can also talk the idea over with other developers over there.
