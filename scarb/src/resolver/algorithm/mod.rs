/// Builds the list of all packages required to build the first argument.
///
/// This is meant to be used by `scarb::resolver::resolve`.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `summaries` - the list of all top-level packages that are intended to be part of
///   the lock file (resolve output).
///   These typically are a list of all workspace members.
///
/// * `registry` - this is the source from which all package summaries are loaded.
///   It is expected that this is extensively configured ahead of time and is idempotent with
///   our requests to it (aka returns the same results for the same query every time).
///   It is also advised to implement internal caching, as the resolver may frequently ask
///   repetitive queries.
///
/// * `lockfile` - a [`Lockfile`] instance, which is used to guide the resolution process. Empty
///   lockfile will result in no guidance. This function does not read or write lock files from
///   the filesystem.
///
/// # Implementation:
///
/// This solution uses the PubGrub version solving algorithm to resolve the dependencies.
/// It is supposed to be very fast and to explain errors more clearly than the alternatives.
///
/// The implementation is based on the Rust crate implementing the PubGrub, from `pubgrub-rs/pubgrub`.
///
/// The implementation consists of two main components:
/// - `ResolverState` responsible for fetching package information.
/// - Resolver that runs the PubGrub algorithm and requests package information.
///
/// These components run on separate threads and communicate via channels.
/// The `ResolverState` deduplicates requests sent to remote package source via `OnceMap`.
/// In the algorithm, a package is represented as a `PubGrubPackage`.
/// Compatibility between dependency version requirements and PubGrub version ranges are provided
/// via `SemverPubgrub` layer from `pubgrub-rs/semver-pubgrub`.
///
/// PubGrub works by defining set of ranges of versions of a single package that are either required
/// or disallowed in the solution. Those ranges are used to construct a set of `incompatibilities`,
/// that is a set of requirements that cannot be all satisfied at once by a valid solution (a set of
/// packages that satisfy all incompatibilities cannot is never a solution of the dependency
/// requirements). During the resolver run, new incompatibilities are derived until a valid solution
/// is found in available versions.
